This project is a reproduction of the classic Snake videogame, using Python and the [Turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#) module. It helped me get back on my coding feet after a short break, and I wanted to make something that would bring me back to my teens when I got my first phone (a Nokia, shocking!) and spent countless hours trying to beat my friends' scores.
